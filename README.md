## Overview

SonataSmooth is a versatile repository that provides three different noise reduction algorithms for smoothing out data: Rectangular Averaging, Binomial Median Filtering, and Binomial Averaging. These algorithms are designed to process data from a list and display the results in another list. Whether you are working on data analysis, noise reduction, or calibration tasks, SonataSmooth has you covered!

## Features

🔹 **Rectangular Averaging:** This algorithm applies a simple rectangular averaging technique to smooth out noisy data points.

🔹 **Binomial Median Filtering:** Utilizing the binomial median filtering approach, this algorithm helps in reducing outliers and noise in the data.

🔹 **Binomial Averaging:** The binomial averaging algorithm provides a unique way to process data using binomial coefficients, resulting in a smoother dataset.
